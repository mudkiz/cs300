    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    In the projects for this course i was trying to program something that parsed a file and organized the data so that i could be searched up and read by someone who typed into the program itself. such as if they wanted to search up a course they would get the course namd and the prerequisites.
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    I approached the problem by first analyzing which data structure I noticed was the mose effective and fast so that my program would be more efficient. Doing the bigO notiation part of project 1 allowed me to see that this was the hash table data structure that was the most efficient and use that.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I had a road block for a bit where i couldnt do anything because I had a workspace error that I had no idea how to solve and had to contat the professor to help me figure it out ove a zoom call. Aside from that there want too many issues besides forgetting a line or two that I had to put in to make the programs work.
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    This project allowed me to understand how different stat structures work and which are better for what objectives. For example when putting more things into a list where it doesnt mattter how theyre ordered a vector is the best whereas if you need to call a specific part of the list instead it would be better to have them put into a hash table.
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    This allowed me to understand better how my functions work together to accomplish what I want them to do as in between the print function and the parser or the menu function calling the lists to print.
